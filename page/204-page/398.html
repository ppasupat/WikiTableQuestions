<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Early_efforts">Early efforts</span></h3>
<p>In 1982, <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_House" title="Melbourne House" class="mw-redirect">Melbourne House</a> began a series of licensed LoTR graphical interactive fiction (text adventure) games with <i><a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit_(video_game)" title="The Hobbit (video game)">The Hobbit</a></i>, based on the book with the same name. The game was considered quite advanced at the time, with interactive characters that moved between locations independent of the player, and Melbourne House's 'Inglish' text parser which accepted full-sentence commands where the norm was simple two-word verb/noun commands. They went on to release 1986's <i><a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_of_the_Rings:_Game_One" title="Lord of the Rings: Game One">The Fellowship of the Ring</a></i>, 1987's <i><a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadows_of_Mordor" title="Shadows of Mordor">The Shadows of Mordor</a></i>, and 1990s <i><a href="//en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Crack_of_Doom&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="The Crack of Doom (page does not exist)">The Crack of Doom</a></i>. A <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro" title="BBC Micro">BBC Micro</a> text adventure released around the same time was unrelated to Melbourne's titles except for the literary origin. In 1987, Melbourne House released <i><a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Middle-earth" title="War in Middle-earth" class="mw-redirect">War in Middle-earth</a></i>, a <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_strategy" title="Real-time strategy">real-time strategy</a> game. Konami also released an action-strategy game titled <i>Riders of Rohan</i>.</p>
<p>Other early efforts included <i>Shadowfax</i> by Postern (1982), a simplistic side-scrolling action game for the Spectrum, C64, and VIC-20, in which Gandalf rides the titular steed while smiting endless Nazgûl. Suspiciously similar in appearance to Activision's <i>Stampede</i>. <i>The Lord of Rings: Journey to Rivendell</i> was announced in 1983 by Parker Brothers for the Atari 2600, but was never released. The prototype ROM can be found at AtariAge.</p>
<p>In 1990, <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplay_Entertainment" title="Interplay Entertainment">Interplay</a>, in collaboration with <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts" title="Electronic Arts">Electronic Arts</a> (who would later obtain the licenses to the film trilogy), released <i>Lord of the Rings Vol. I</i> (a special CD-ROM version of which featured cut-scenes from <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ralph_Bakshi" title="Ralph Bakshi">Ralph Bakshi</a>'s <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(1978_film)" title="The Lord of the Rings (1978 film)">animated adaptation</a>) and the following year's <i>Lord of the Rings Vol. II: The Two Towers</i>, a series of <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game" title="Role-playing video game">role-playing video games</a> based on the events of the first two books. A third installment was planned, but never released. Interplay's games mostly appeared on the PC and Amiga, but later they did a <i>Lord of the Rings</i> game for the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Nintendo_Entertainment_System" title="Super Nintendo Entertainment System">SNES</a>, which played nothing like their PC games and instead was more like <i><a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda_(video_game)" title="The Legend of Zelda (video game)">The Legend of Zelda</a></i>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Film_trilogy_revival">Film trilogy revival</span></h3>
<p>Thereafter, no official <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> titles were released until the making of <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Jackson" title="Peter Jackson">Peter Jackson</a>'s <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_film_trilogy" title="The Lord of the Rings film trilogy" class="mw-redirect">The Lord of the Rings film trilogy</a> for <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Line_Cinema" title="New Line Cinema">New Line Cinema</a> in 2001-2003, when mass-market awareness of the story appeared. <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts" title="Electronic Arts">Electronic Arts</a> obtained the licenses for the three films, <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Entertainment" title="Sierra Entertainment">Sierra Entertainment</a> obtained the license to produce games based on the books from <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tolkien_Enterprises" title="Tolkien Enterprises" class="mw-redirect">Tolkien Enterprises</a> - this gave rise to an unusual situation: Electronic Arts produced no adaptation of <i><a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring" title="The Fellowship of the Ring">The Fellowship of the Ring</a></i>, but produced adaptations named <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Two_Towers_(video_game)" title="The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (video game)"><i>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</i> (video game)</a> (which covered events of both the first two films) and <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Return_of_the_King_(video_game)" title="The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (video game)"><i>The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</i> (video game)</a>, whereas Sierra only produced a game covering the first book of the trilogy, <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring_(video_game)" title="The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (video game)"><i>The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</i> (video game)</a>. While Sierra Entertainment's access to the book rights prevented them from using material from the film, it permitted them to include elements of <i>The Lord of the Rings</i> which were not in the films. EA, on the other hand, were not permitted to do this, as they were only licensed to develop games based on the films, which left out elements of the original story or deviated in places.</p>
<p>In 2003 Sierra produced an adaptation of <i><a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit" title="The Hobbit">The Hobbit</a></i>, aimed at a younger audience: <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hobbit_(2003_video_game)" title="The Hobbit (2003 video game)"><i>The Hobbit</i> (2003 video game)</a>, as well as a realtime strategy game <i><a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_War_of_the_Ring" title="The Lord of the Rings: War of the Ring">The Lord of the Rings: War of the Ring</a></i> both based on Tolkien's literature.</p>
<p>Further spinoffs from the film trilogy were produced: A real time strategy game <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Battle_for_Middle-earth" title="The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth">The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth</a>, and turn based role-playing game <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Third_Age" title="The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age">The Lord of the Rings: The Third Age</a> were released in 2004, and a <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Portable" title="PlayStation Portable">PSP</a>-exclusive title, <i><a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_Tactics" title="The Lord of the Rings: Tactics">The Lord of the Rings: Tactics</a></i> in 2005.</p>
<p>In 2005, EA secured the rights to both the films and the books, thus the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Battle_for_Middle-earth_II" title="The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II">The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II</a> incorporated elements of the film adaptions, and the original Tolkienesque lore. EA also began work on an open world <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_video_game" title="Role-playing video game">role-playing video game</a> called <i><a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_White_Council" title="The Lord of the Rings: The White Council">The Lord of the Rings: The White Council</a></i>, development of the game was cancelled in 2007.</p>
